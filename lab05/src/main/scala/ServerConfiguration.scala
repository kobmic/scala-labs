// FIXME
// define singleton ServerConfiguration
// with port, host and a method that returns an url

// TIP
// Remember that Scala's Uniform Acces Principle means
// that variables and functions without parameters are
// accessed in the same way. So you are free to implement
// the 'url' as method, variable or constant
